## üîê Security Features

- **Scrypt Key Derivation**: Passwords are strengthened using the Scrypt KDF, protecting against brute-force attacks.
- **Memory Sanitization**: Sensitive data like passwords and keys are wiped from memory after use.
- **Secure Randomness**: Uses `os.urandom` and `SystemRandom` for cryptographically secure generation of salts, nonces, and filenames.
- **File Hiding**: Automatically hides system ID file on supported platforms.
- **GCM Mode**: Ensures both encryption and verification using AES in Galois/Counter Mode.
