## üß∞ Features

- **AES-GCM Encryption**: Utilizes authenticated encryption to ensure confidentiality and integrity.
- **System-bound Transfers**: Encrypted files can be locked to a specific device using a unique system ID, making it impossible to open on other device without system ID give.
- **Randomized Filenames**: Optionally obfuscate output files with randomized names.
- **Auto Destruction**: Files can be set to self-destruct after a configurable number of failed decryption attempts.
- **Metadata Protection**: Metadata is encrypted and authenticated to avoid tampering.
- **Secure Delete**: Optionally overwrite and remove the original file after encryption.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Built with `Tkinter` and `ttkthemes` for a modern dark-mode interface.
- **Clipboard Support**: Quickly copy system ID via GUI for secure transfers.

## üîê Security Features

- **Scrypt Key Derivation**: Passwords are strengthened using the Scrypt KDF, protecting against brute-force attacks.
- **Memory Sanitization**: Sensitive data like passwords and keys are wiped from memory after use.
- **Secure Randomness**: Uses `os.urandom` and `SystemRandom` for cryptographically secure generation of salts, nonces, and filenames.
- **File Hiding**: Automatically hides system ID file on supported platforms.
- **GCM Mode**: Ensures both encryption and verification using AES in Galois/Counter Mode.
- **File diversification**: Diversifying secured file into .enc and .info files. File with .enc extension is main one, and .info is extra information about first one. Both are encrypted and one cant be opened without another
- It will not open if the file was tampered with too.
- **Extra security layer**: Generating extra string spread in two files, and files can only be matched if System ID, password, and string matches.
